## User Stories (MVP)
//developer//
 - I want to create an app that displays potential products to individual focus groups.
 - I want to display 3 random images at a time for the user to chose from.
 - I want to store data of which products were clicked on within the 15 times
 - I want to assign a vote to the product clicked each time.
 - I want to show results only after all 15 clicks took place.
 - I want to then has the group members choose the one they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.

//market researcher//
 - I want to create a market analysis on proposed products to test potential customer interests
 - I want to only feature most popular items in our catalog based on focus group feedback to slim marketing costs.
 - I do not want the results to be shown to the user until there has been a total of 15 selections made.

//focus group//
 - I want a nice, clean, user-friendly site (You are also responsible for the look and feel of the app, so don't forget a custom font, color palette, layout with semantic HTML (and maybe a Skeleton or flexbox approach to layout) and so on.)
 - I want to be informed on the products
 - I want clear instructions on the analysis performed.
 - I want to see my results visually
